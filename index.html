                    The best way to maximise productivity and effectiveness is through the proper communication. To

                    With every project, either personal, university project or work, I am challenged and expected to analyse

                    analysed. All this improves problem solving and critical thinking as well as planning and analythical thinking.

                    As I am in constant pursuit of new challenges and projects, freelancing seemed to be a good
                    choice. 
                    <br><br> I have been freelancing on few web app development projects for almost a year now. 
                    
                    <br><br>As a freelancer, I can choose the projects I want to work on what gives me the 
                    freedom of always doing what I find the most interesting and useful.

                    <br><br>Other than freelancing, I have been doing some online courses and working through 
                    tutorials. 
                    
                    <br><br>Mobile application development is a topic in software development that has been 
                    becoming more and more interesting to me, so I decided to learn more. 
                    <br> I have worked on few demo applications covering basics of Flutter. 

                    <br><br> As one of the courses I have finished on Udemy expanded to include Web3 and Blockchain
                    modules, I have been working on finishing the course to gain practical skills to develop dApps
                    using Solidity and React
                    
                    <br><br>One other field of computing that has been an interest of mine for some time is Cyber 
                    Security. To familiarise myself with the topic, I have been doing some online tutorials on 
                    ethical hacking and the methods used for ethical hacking.
                    
                    <br><br>As software engineering is a discipline which requires constant learning and practice, 
                    I am always working on something or learning something new.
